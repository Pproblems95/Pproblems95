IÂ´m looking forward to collaborate with new people that want to create new big and ambitous projects.
iÂ´m currently on fourth semester in ITT. 
iÂ´m learning english and iÂ´m learning code.
If you ask me about my hobbies, I like  listening to music, playing videogames, playing guitar, eating new food and, sometimes, meeting new people.
If you want to reach me, you can email me to *l21212001@tectijuana.edu.mx*
##My plans for the future
iÂ´d like to work on something related to virtual reality since I like the concept of being able to create a digital world where you can do whatever you want, maybe assembling a team of engineers with the same idea and skills to pull it through.
